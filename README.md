Abstract:
<br/>

Bodily signals can modulate the access of external stimuli to perceptual awareness. Afferent cardiac information can affect sensory processing – which has been shown mainly in the visual and the auditory modality. Here, we examined variations in perceptual sensitivity for somatosensory stimuli across the entire cardiac cycle. We recorded electrocardiograms of33healthy male and female volunteers while near-threshold electrical pulses at a fixed intensity were applied to their left index finger. Circular statistics showed that the detection performance was not uniformly distributed across the cardiac cycle: near-threshold stimuli presented towards the end of the cardiac cycle (at diastole) were more likely to be correctly detected (hits), whereas stimuli presented earlier in the cardiac cycle (at systole) showed a tendency to be missed. Analysis based on signal detection theory indicated that the accumulation of hits towards the end of the cardiac cycle was due to a higher sensitivity but not due to changes in response criterion. Our findings demonstrate that perceptual awareness for somatosensory stimuli varies across the cardiac cycle and that periodic modulations of perception occur in other sensory modalities than in vision. This supports the view that the physiological state of the body shapes how we perceive the world.

Abstract:
<br/>

Fluctuations in the heart’s activity can modulate the access of external stimuli to consciousness. The link between perceptual awareness and cardiac signals has been investigated mainly in the visual and auditory domains. We here investigated whether the phase of the cardiac cycle and the pre-stimulus heart rate influence conscious somatosensory perception. We also tested how conscious detection of somatosensory stimuli affects the heart rate. Electrocardiograms (ECG) of 33 healthy volunteers were recorded while applying near-threshold electrical pulses at a fixed intensity to the left index finger. Conscious detection was not uniformly distributed across the cardiac cycle but significantly higher in diastole than in systole. We found no evidence that the heart rate before a stimulus influenced its detection but hits (correctly detected somatosensory stimuli) led to a more pronounced cardiac deceleration than misses. Our findings demonstrate interactions between cardiac activity and conscious somatosensory perception, which highlights the importance of internal bodily states for sensory processing beyond the auditory and visual domain.

Data analysis:

Folder "_scripts" contains the codes used for the main and supplementary analyses. If you want to run your own preprocessing (performed in the sections 1-3 of the main code: CCSomato_analysis_main.html), please contact the corresponding author for the raw data (output from Kubios analysis for each participant). Folder "_dataframes" contains preprocessed data saved as the outputs from particular sections of the code. This enables starting analysis of preprocessed data at different sections of the code by reading the releveant data frames using the prepared lines of the code at the beginnings of sections. For example, one could read "CCSomato_ECG_data(output_from_section_3)" at the beginning of section nr 4 and run the following sections or start directly from the later sections by reading outpus from sections nr 4 or 7. The same procedure regards supplementary results. The codes along with their outputs can be also previewed by downloading and opening the revelant html files from "_scripts". Folder "_figures" contains the plots from the main manuscript and supplementry results.
